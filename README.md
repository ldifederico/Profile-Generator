## Profile Generator

A command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from the user's GitHub username. The GitHub API will retrieve the profile picture, location, profile link, blog, bio, number of public repositories, number of followers and number of users following based on the input username. The user will be prompted to select a colour that will generate the background colours of the new generated profile. The application allows fast, up-to-date team member information generation when preparing reports for stakeholders.
